## Migration Recommendations

### Suggested Migration Strategy
**Medium complexity** - Incremental model with DCF hooks recommended

### DCF Mapping
- **Error Handling**: Convert `.IF ERRORCODE` patterns to DCF error handling macros
- **File Operations**: Replace IMPORT/EXPORT with dbt seeds or external tables
- **Statistics**: Replace COLLECT STATS with Snowflake post-hooks
- **Stored Procedures**: Map CALL statements to DCF stored procedure macros
